# Cargo configuration for GoudEngine

[build]
# Use all available CPU cores for compilation
jobs = -1

# NOTE: target-cpu=native was removed because it causes SIGILL errors on CI
# when cached build artifacts are reused on runners with different CPUs.
# For local performance optimization, you can set CARGO_RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"
